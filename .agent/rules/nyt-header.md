Follow the **New York Times (NYT)** style for headlines to create new and / or review markdown headers.

Markdown headers are marked with #, ##, ###, ...

The **New York Times (NYT)** style for headlines is distinct from other major styles (like AP or Chicago). It combines a "length rule" with a specific list of exceptions.

Here are the rules they follow:

### 1. The Golden Rule: 4 Letters or More

If a word has **4 letters or more**, you **always** capitalize it.

* *Examples:* **From**, **With**, **Into**, **Like**, **Than**, **That**, **This**, **Your**.
* *Contrast:* AP and Chicago often lowercase short prepositions like "with" or "from." NYT capitalizes them because they meet the 4-letter threshold.

### 2. Major Words (Always Capitalized)

Regardless of length, always capitalize the first and last words, and all "principal" parts of speech:

* **Nouns** (*Art, Era*)
* **Pronouns** (*He, She, It, We*)
* **Verbs** (*Is, Are, Be, Go, Do*)
* **Adjectives** (*Old, New, Red*)
* **Adverbs** (*Now, Then*)

### 3. The "Special List" (Exceptions)

This is where NYT differs most from other guides. They **capitalize** these specific short words (even though they are less than 4 letters):

* **Off**
* **Out**
* **Up**
* **Nor** (NYT is unique in capitalizing "Nor")
* **So**
* **Yet** (when used as a conjunction or adverb)

### 4. What Stays Lowercase (The Short List)

You only lowercase words that are **3 letters or fewer** AND are **not** on the special list above or a major word (noun/verb).

* **Articles:** a, an, the
* **Conjunctions:** and, but, or, for
* **Prepositions:** at, by, in, of, on, to (including the "to" in infinitives like *to Go*)
* **Others:** as, if

### 5. Hyphenated Words

Always capitalize the **first element**. Capitalize the **subsequent elements** if they are principal words or 4+ letters.

* *Example:* **State-of-the-Art** ("of" and "the" are lowercase because they are short; "Art" is capitalized because it is a noun/major word).
* *Example:* **Follow-Up** ("Up" is on the special exception list).
